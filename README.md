## Inspiration
Trump's tweet about Lockheed-Martin cuts $4 billion in value. Musk's $420 price per share announcement cost 11% shaved off of Tesla's price. Studies have demonstrated Twitter chatter strongly correlates with short-term stock market activity. When combined with sentiment-based trading methods, Twitter analysis may be a powerful tool for successful day-traders. 

## What it does
Twitter Trader is a powerful real-time natural language processing application that weâ€™ve designed to scrape Twitter for the sentiment from politicians, executives, and the media that could affect short-term equity prices.

## How we built it
Twitter API, Stock API, NLP Library, pandas.

## Challenges we ran into
While we had a group of four, two of our group members were more business oriented so a lot of the coding was done by two people, while the other two directed the path of our coding as well as working on the presentation/logo. It was our first time trying to implement RESTful APIs, as well as the email automation through a python script that made us hit major roadblocks.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Many times we were uncertain if we could get through the roadblocks we encountered. However, we were able to get a working product within the short amount of time with more implementations with stock info and email automation included. We really believe our idea is innovative and it was a great learning experience.

## What we learned
- Implementation of RESTful APIs using the Python packaged requests and Tweepy.
- Implementation of email automation using smtplib package.
- Implementation of a _BackgroundScheduler_ to automate our program to run a check for tweets frequently.
- Entrepreneurship/teamwork skills to create a program and presentation with people from different backgrounds (Edward & Sejin: Computer Science, Harrison: Psychology/Business, Oliver: Finance)



## What's next for Twitter Trader
- A web GUI that allows users to change their profile. (i.e. add more usernames to follow etc)
- Mobile App integration for push notifications. 
- Refined and specialized NLP capabilities. 
- Machine learning powered regressions for price predictions over time. 
- Automated mutual fund offerings.
